// This file simulates MongoDB connection configuration for a React frontend app
// In a real production application, MongoDB connections would be handled on the server side

// Note: For security reasons, frontend applications should never directly connect to MongoDB
// Instead, they should use an API service that handles authentication and database operations

export const MONGODB_CONFIG = {
  // In a real application, these would be environment variables on the server side
  // These are placeholders to indicate where MongoDB configuration would go
  connectionString: "mongodb://localhost:27017/sportsselection",
  
  // In a production application, you would use:
  // 1. A backend API with proper authentication
  // 2. MongoDB Atlas or a self-hosted MongoDB server
  // 3. Proper connection pooling and error handling
};

// User database structure (simulated with localStorage in our app)
export const DATABASE_STRUCTURE = {
  collections: {
    users: {
      schema: {
        id: "string (primary key)",
        username: "string (unique)",
        password: "string (hashed in real app)",
        email: "string (optional)",
        phone: "string (optional)",
        role: "string (user or admin)",

        name: "string",
        sport: "string",
        // ... other player fields
      }
    }
  }
};

// In a real MongoDB implementation, we would:
// 1. Set up a Node.js/Express backend
// 2. Use MongoDB driver or Mongoose ODM
// 3. Create proper schemas and models
// 4. Implement authentication middleware
// 5. Create REST or GraphQL API endpoints for the frontend to call
